## Introduction
This React-based admin dashboard showcases my front-end development skills and was inspired by a [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5hdo50a2M). 

Built using React, Tailwind CSS, Syncfusion, React Router, and Context API, it includes features like data visualization, responsive design, and user management.

The project demonstrates my ability to work with modern tools, build scalable applications, and create clean, functional designs.
